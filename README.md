# IC Dragon

IC Dragon is a dice-roll game powered by ICP on-chain Randomizer
This game is a testament to how provably secure randomness can be achieved fully on-chain on ICP â€” a follow-up to Jan Camenisch's tweet here.

## Game Play

1. Connect wallet and get a new wallet address auto generated for you.
2. Transfer some ICP to your new wallet address.
3. Buy ticket and roll the dice!
